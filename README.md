This PID_controller library is documented in a blog post here:  https://jowood4.wordpress.com/2015/01/04/arduino-pid-temperature-controller/

It requires a couple of library dependencies:

1.  PID_v1.  There is a copy in my repo, and it is based on this code:  https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library/
2.  MAX31855.  Also in my repo.  This is the temp sensor I used, but your code could be adapted to use any temp sensor.
